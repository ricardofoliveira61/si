class StackingClassifier(Model):
    """
    A stacking classifier is an ensemble learning technique that combines multiple base models to create
    a more powerful and accurate predictive model. It's a meta-learning approach where a meta-model learns to combine the predictions of the base models.

    How it Works:

    Base Models:
    Multiple base models (e.g., decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, neural networks) are trained on the same training dataset.
    Each model learns patterns and relationships within the data and makes predictions on a given dataset.
    
    Generating Predictions:
    Each base model makes predictions on the same dataset, generating a set of predictions for each data point.
    
    Creating a New Dataset:
    The predictions from all base models for each data point are combined into a new dataset.
    Each row in this new dataset represents a data point, and each column represents the prediction from a specific base model.
    
    Training the Meta-Model:
    A meta-model (e.g., logistic regression, another decision tree, or a neural network) is trained on this new dataset.
    The meta-model learns to combine the predictions from the base models to make a final, more accurate prediction.
    
    Key Advantages of Stacking Classifiers:
    Improved Performance: Stacking often leads to significantly improved performance compared to individual models, especially when the base models are diverse and complementary.
    Reduced Overfitting: By combining multiple models, stacking can help mitigate overfitting, which occurs when a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely.
    Enhanced Robustness: Stacking can make the overall model more robust to noise and variations in the data.
    Better Generalization: Stacking can improve the model's ability to generalize to unseen data.
